Task 1
Create three threads so that one thread prints out 1, the other 2, and the last one 3. All three threads should be created in main function. Thread 1 should sleep for 3 seconds and then print its number and finish. Thread 2 should join thread 1, then print its number and finish. Thread 3 should join thread 2, prints its number and finish. In function main join thread 3.

Task 2
Implement two threads. Threads should share two resources, i.e. two integer variables. Each variable is protected with its own mutex. The first thread writes the following pairs of value to those two variables: {(1,2),(3,4),(5,6)}. It repeats the sequence when it reached the end. Second thread read the shared variables, sums their values and prints the result on screen. Threads do not need to be synchronized, but the second thread should be only allowed to see consistent state of two variables, i.e. the only output should be 3, 7, or 11.
